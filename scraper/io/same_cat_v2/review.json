{"reviewTxt": "Devotional image from Rick Warren \u201cWe capture every thought and make it give up and obey Christ\u201d (2 Corinthians 10:5b NCV). Here\u2019s the secret to temptation: Don\u2019t fight it. Just refocus. Whatever you resist persists. Did you know that in the Bible, not once are you told to resist temptation? We are told to resist the Devil, and that\u2019s a whole different issue. But the key to overcoming temptation is not to push back. It\u2019s to change your focus. Whatever gets your attention gets you. The battle for sin always starts in the mind. That\u2019s why the Bible says in Psalm 119:6, \u201cThinking about your commands will keep me from doing some foolish thing\u201d (CEV). Why? Because if you\u2019re thinking about God\u2019s truth, you\u2019re not thinking about the less important stuff. It\u2019s true in every single area of life \u2014 good or bad. If you focus on godly things, it\u2019s going to pull you that direction. If you focus on the stuff that\u2019s at the movies and in magazines, it\u2019s going to pull you that direction. Whatever you focus on gets your attention. Whatever gets your attention is going to get you.

Once I figured the right dose out for a cleanse (I just need 3), I was able to sleep through the night and use the bathroom at my own leisure upon waking. My BMs were somewhere between soft and diarrhea but I was going much more regularly, not urgently. Following a night of Mag07, I would start my day with Pearls IC probiotics and found that this a great combo! Upon completetion of the 10-day cleanse, I have continued to take 1 capsule before bed for maintenance. My insides have never felt better which of course, have reflected on the outside! My belly feels flat and my digestive system no longer feels stopped up. I swear, I can actually feel my body utilizing vitamins that I used to feel pass right through, never fully absorbing.

{"reviewTxt": "*This review may be somewhat graphic if you are uncomfortable talking about bowel movements* I started using this recently after hearing an ad on the radio.  I have been struggling with constipation from medication for a long time and have used many different products.  Recently I was blocked up so bad I literally could not gather the strength to push.  I was out of steam and just could not go.  I said to myself I was not going to struggle anymore and find something to flush me out. I bought this and at first I took 3 at night, but nothing happened.  So I upped it to 5.  No change, so I took 7 the next night.  I woke up a few times very thirsty and drank a lot of water.  When I woke up, I felt that I may have to go.  It was not a overwhelming \"I don't know if I can make it to the bathroom\"  type feeling.  There was no cramping, just a little gas.  But wow, the floodgates opened and with hardly  any straining or pushing at all, everything came out.  I went 4 or 5 more times that day.  It liquefied the whole blockage very gently with no uncomfortable cramping.  I felt so much better inside and relieved that I didn't have to worry about how I was going to get through my next movement.  People who suffer from constant constipation know what I mean.  I take 3 every day and maybe 5 when I feel I need it.  I have never strained or felt uncomfortable since.  If you are suffering please try it, and if it doesn't work keep upping the dose until it happens and make sure to drink a lot of water!  It needs water to work.

{"reviewTxt": "This stuff is truly a Godsend!  I happened to read about it on a BabyCenter.com forum when I was searching desperately for something to help with our 2-year old's constipation.  We had tried everything!  Miralax worked, but made her go 5-7 times per day and she would get rashes.  I think she was still trying to hold it in.  Anyway, Miralax, Pedialax, Milk of Magnesia, Benefiber, Citrucel, (of course fiber and hydration were the first things we tried), mineral oil, we tried it all.  Finally we had to resort to enemas when her belly would get so hard.  After holding her down and hearing her scream, we were traumatized and I said, \"That's IT!  We've got to find something that will help her!\"  We heard about this, ordered it and started giving her half a capsule in some yogurt or applesauce nightly (she weighed about 25 lbs).  It was truly miraculous.  In 2 days her compacted bowels emptied without cramping and pain or diarrhea.  She was no longer trying to hold it in.  It didn't make things to runny like with the Miralax.  It was just NORMAL.  We couldn't believe it.  She's been taking them ever since at night with some fiber gummies (it seems to work best together like that).  She's now 3, goes on the toilet every day, and happily takes her \"Nighttime Medicine\" just before bed each night.  This stuff seriously saved us.  We showed it to her pediatrician, by the way, and got his blessing for her to take it.  He said it's pretty much the same active ingredient as Milk of Magnesia, but it sure works better.

{"reviewTxt": "I got this for my husband who had to take a drug test for work - I read on the reviews that it is recommended to be entirely drug-free for at least 48-72 hours before doing this cleanse. He had stopped smoking on Saturday night, started drinking a lot of water on Sunday through Tuesday and had the test scheduled for Wednesday. He took the cleanse drink on an empty stomach as recommended on Wednesday morning with more water. The pros: The test came back with a very faint positive for THC - he said the line was very thin and barely visible which luckily in his case resulted in a pass. The cons: It turned his urine a fluorescent yellow/green!! If your drug test is monitored at a more strict level, depending on the testing agency, you may not pass because the brightness can indicate tampering. So there you have it - this was my husband's experience and hopefully you won't have the same fluoresence issue that he had because that was really unusual and made him stood out but fortunately, he ended up passing anyway.", "verifiedPurchase": true, "title": "Watch out for the bright pee!", "timestamp": "2016-10-17 10:40:06", "vine": false, "starRating": 3.0, "memberId": "AFK4LOVENJEC5", "nComments": 0, "date": "on June 10, 2016", "productId": "B005VOZSP2", "id": "R1C6EN9F3APL1Z", "helpful": [21]}

{"reviewTxt": "I was selected for a random drug test for a company I worked for but I smoked 4 days before it! I was freaking out and was researching what product was the best and I came across this! I was super hesitant but was deseperate for anything. So I ordered it over night and it came the next day. I took the drug test and was clean as a whistle!  If you do take this you want to take it right! This is what I did: -1 hour before I drank the detox, I drank 16oz of water (About 2 glasses) -MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT EAT ANYTHING BEFORE DRINKING THIS. I never learned the hard way but honestly the way this drink tasted I almost vomited. It isn't the best tasting drink haha but hey! It'll save your ass! If you do however have a sensitive stomach, I would recommend eating something light like toast or crackers. -Shake the bottle very very well to mix up all those vitamins and other magical ingredients -Pace yourself while drinking this! You HAVE to drink ALL 32 ounces and it doesn't taste that great haha I used a chaser after it (cranberry juice worked well) just take it down and chase it like its vodka! haha -After you drink the detox, wait 15 minutes. Then fill the bottle back up with regular water (make sure you rinse the bottle very thoroughly to get rid of that nasty taste left over) and drink all of the water. -Allow at least 60 minutes for the the herbal cleanse to kick in and to become most effective. It lasts about 5 hours so I took my test about 1.5-2 hours after I drank the detox -Urinate at least 3-4 times before taking the test and you should be perfect! The thing I was afraid of was if my urine was going to look all diluted before the test, but the herbal cleanse contains a lot of vitamins in it, including B-12 which gives your urine its natural yellow-like color. I noticed my urine smelt a little like vitamins but the guy didn't really seem to notice. I took a 5-pannel quick test (which is the test they don't send to the lab and use the testing strips to detect the drug). They use the ones that you can buy at the local smoke shop or drug store.

{"reviewTxt": "People who say this product does NOT work are idiots. They are individuals who did not follow the instructions. This does NOT just cleanse your system. If you drink water and properly time it with your drug test you will have a 2-3ish hour window where your urine will be masked and the THC in your system will not be detectable. Again this requires drinking a lot of water, timing it. (I suggest you read the most helpful reviews and figure it out for yourself) peeing multiple times after drinking it just to be safe. But if you genuinely want to pass your test you will be able to as long as you put in the time/effort. This also requires NOT touching THC for at least in my opinion 48hrs. (I stayed clean for 13 days because I was lucky, but I was still testing positive for THC 2 nights before my test, after this drink though I did a at home drug test, NEGATIVE. I tested immediately after my screening test, NEGATIVE. 2 days after I was positive. Moral of the story, this stuff will work and help you pass your test. But it WILL NOT cleanse your system fully it will NOT FLUSH THC out. It will simply mask your urine for a certain amount of time.

{"reviewTxt": "OK, so here's my situation and how it played out. You can compare it to other reviews on here and decide for yourself if its worth the buy. I personally think the product is a lifesaver and I would entirely recommend its use. I recently graduated from a University and knew I would be embarking on a job hunt. With that in mind, I stopped smoking altogether. Prior to this, I was a daily user. I would smoke at least once a day and quite often would partake in the habit 3 or more times a day. I am 220 pounds with a high body mass index. My regular use dates back 4/5 years. About two weeks into my purge, I was called back for a job offer and had to take a drug test a couple days later. So, I had only stopped smoking for 17 days in total on the day of my drug test. I bought this product and got it delivered same-day. I was skeptical because most sites I reviewed said THC stays in your system for 30 days at least. However, I followed the instructions on the bottle and a couple days later I found out I had passed the test!!! I would say, I am honestly surprised at the results of my test and don't think I could have passed without this product. I would warn potential buyers though, if you plan on smoking up until the day of your test this product may not work. I was lucky enough to have a 2 week buffer that helped diminish the amount of THC in my system ahead of time. This product then did the rest of the work.

{"reviewTxt": "If you are buying this because you are in desperate need of passing a \"test\" then this should be your go-to product. Ignore all of the reviews that say this doesnt work because it DOES. Im a female about 140lbs, heavy smoker (about 2 times a day for the last couple of months) and I stopped smoking about 4 days before taking this drink. Follow the directions that some of the other reviewers suggested, this drink will only give you a couple of HOURS to test negative. For example, I woke up at 9am and drank about 8 ounces of water and tested myself with some at home test strips, it was positive. So then I proceeded to drink the entire bottle of herbal clean( i took a break halfway through the bottle to drink a whole 16 ounce bottle of water). It tastes horrible so I was able to finish by 11:30am. I went to the bathroom like 2-3 times and by the time i went to the bathroom a 4th time it was about 12:15pm so I decided to test myself with some at-home test strips. I tested NEGATIVE!! The drink does make urine look fluorescent yellow so i decided to only drink a half a bottle of water because i didnt want it to be clear to the specimen collector that i was diluting. By the time i got to the lab to give my sample if was almost 1:30pm. After that I went home and for my own sanity i tested myself again (2:30pm)...Still came up NEGATIVE but the line on the test strip was fading so i knew time was running out. I would say the window for testing is anywhere from 3-6 hours after you start drinking herbal clean. Im giving this product 4 starts because it does exactly what it claims to do, but i did have a horrible stomach ache for the rest of the day (it could have just been me but w/e i'll take a stomach ache over a failed test any day) .I think the drink will work even if you have a shorter amount of time to get clean but the bottle does say to stop ingesting toxins for at least 2 days before you begin.", "verifiedPurchase": true, "title": "Does the job", "timestamp": "2016-10-17 10:40:07", "vine": false, "starRating": 4.0, "memberId": "A2YMK0KC8PS668", "nComments": 0, "date": "on May 12, 2015", "productId": "B005VOZSP2", "id": "R2GSORED7A6EFO", "helpful": [74]}

{"reviewTxt": "I searched for this product to replace a different brand that is much too expensive, PoopDoc.  Love the name, but don't like the price.  After reading the Mag 07 label, reading the instructions, and seeing that the feedback is pretty much the same; I decided it has to be the same product.  After trying it, I'm happy that it IS the same product and for about 1/2 the price! I am 64 and have had severe constipation frequently since I've been 2 years old.  No one knew about dairy intolerance when I was growing up and my family ate dairy products every day.  Even when I learned about it in my early thirties, I didn't know it wasn't lactose ... It was milk protein or something like that which causes the opposite effect.  Anyway, not eating dairy helped, but apparently all those years of eating it caused a very sluggish system.  When I say \"severe\" constipation, I mean once or twice a week was a good week. There were many times I didn't go for two weeks ... awful.  Doctors were unhelpful so I had to resort to expensive and possibly dependency-forming products in the drug store.  Sometimes laxatives didn't even work nor did prune juice until after taking it for three or four days.  Sorry for the boring story, but I'm a great test case for this product. Thanks to this formula, I can have a healthier digestive track and I feel a lot better. Since it only affects the material inside the intestine instead of forcing the intestine to contract, you don't have to worry about dependency.  I did do the 3-day cleanse by taking 5 capsules nightly.  Yes, of course that causes diarrhea, but amazingly there is no discomfort or cramping.  After that, it does take awhile to figure out what dosage is right for you for maintenance.  I don't take it every night.  It seems to be fine to take it every other night or even every 3 nights (for me).  I take two plus one magnesium citrate supplement at the same time.  They seem to work well together.  If I've had ice cream or pizza, i have to take 3.  The minimum you must take at one time depends on your individual system. For me, one is not enough to work, so I always take 2 or more. Remember that Mag 07 is not a replacement for magnesium supplementation.  That form is not as absorbable in the body as other forms of magnesium, at least that seems to be the concensus of the majority.  Also, do not take Vitamin C in the evening when you take Mag 07.  It seems to prevent it from working.  The nights I forgot and took Vitamin C, the Mag 07 did not work at all so was a waste of pills.

I had to grab a handful of yellow, for example, find a sharp one, use it to pre-push several holes, and then put a \"dull-end\" tack in the hole made with the sharp tack. Second problem is the head of two of the tacks just came apart from the rest of the tack as I began to push it into the map.  Not fun to search the floor for tiny sharp bits that will inevitably end up in my heel. Third thing I should mention is that I knew I was getting a short tack, but just a word of warning that these are truly short tacks.  They are about as tall as my pinky finger is wide.

{"reviewTxt": "I have several locations that I manage for my job so I wanted a map on the wall in my office for a reference point, I was searching for some pins that I could use and came across these. I was excited for them initially because of the bright colors that were displayed in the picture. When I received the product in the mail you can see my disappointment when compared to the actual picture that the actual pins are nothing like the picture that is displayed. The green is the prime example, in the picture of the product it displays a lime green and the actual product is a dark green. Not that it really matters but if it's going to be green, put it green in the product picture, not lime green. I started pushing the pins on the map once I got to my office and a couple of times the head on the tack fell off of the pin.It isn't that it was a plaster wall that I was pushing these pins into, it was Sheetrock. I am just glad that when they arrived they were all in the same package unlike some others that have received these. For what I paid for the pins, they do definitely do the job that I ask, and I am overall pleased with what they are.

{"reviewTxt": "I am a small petite woman:  5'1 and 114 lbs.  Have stopped smoking all together many months ago as it was causing breathing issues.  I then moved onto edibles.  I only ate edibles when I have time and money.  So it's hard to label myself but if I had to, then I would say moderate.  I also tend to get high potency/high quality edibles.  I stopped edibles 4 weeks ago - this will be my 5th week of abstaining.  I took several home tests and came back positive for THC/weed/pot.  I have a test in 5 days for a high salary job.  I ordered from Amazon a pack of home test strips, as well as 2 bottles of qCarbo.  One to test at home and if it worked, then the other bottle for day of the test.  I have read with great anxiety many reviews over the past few days and here is my review.  Keep in mind that a positive test for weed is 1 line and a negative test is 2 lines. Sunday:  drank as much water/cranberry juice as I could stomach.  Did 20 mins in the dry sauna. Monday:  my Amazon products arrived.  This is the timeline where I documented everything exactly as it happened... 9:55 am - test strip with one solid line (POSITIVE test- I failed). 10 am - 10:04 am:  chugged qCarbo 10:15 am - went to bathroom and had diarrhea (don't know if that's from breakfast and qcarbo combined but don't take qcarbo on full stomach!) 10:35 am - saw a faint second line on my test strip! 10:35 am - 11 am:  peed 2 more times without testing. 11:08 am - Second line of test strip is becoming more solid!  Looks like I'm passing! 11:35 - peed again without testing 12:00 - peed again and tested but the second line is more faint than the last test 12:20 pm - 12:50 pm: sat in sauna to sweat out 1:00 pm - Peed again and tested positive - the second line keeps getting more faint as time passes and it's only been 3 hours. 1:17 - 1:22 pm:  Chugged another qCarbo 1:36 pm - diarrhea again.  I recommend staying home if you have to drink this stuff. 1:52 pm - 2:17 pm:  peed 3 times.  I read that you have to pee at least 3 times within the first hour. 2:15pm:  tested again and it came back with 2 lines - 1 definitely solid and the other one solid but faint but still there!  Passable. Lesson learned - for me, this stuff only works after 1 hour - any more time that passes came back as positive.

{"reviewTxt": "This product worked great for me. I last smoked 8 days before the drug test and I was smoking fairly regularly before that.

I drank two more 16 oz bottles of water over the course of 3 hours leading up to the test. I probably pissed a dozen times before taking the test. After going 4 times, I performed two home drug tests to make sure I was good before taking the one for the new job. I think some people don't wait long enough between drinking the drink and taking the test, or they don't drink enough water. DRINK LOTS OF WATER! This is why there are one star reviews on here. I read that in some cases, they test for this type of drink. If you don't wait long enough, there's too much of this stuff in your system and you fail. Honestly, I think you may not even need this drink. Just drink as much water as you can, at least a half gallon. Then once you pee at least 3 times, your pee should be clean for at least an hour or two. It will just be water that goes right through your system without picking up much of anything.

I am completing a project with a bulletin board for a loved one, and I like the look of these push pins. I really enjoy many of the aspects of these pins, and I am interested in seeing how they work.

Since I was already planning to buy several items, I was able to get these at the add-on item price, which is pretty amazing. There is more than enough for all of my purposes, which I'm really happy about. I will add a list of pros and cons below to help you get a better idea of why I like these pins. Pros: Price point - These pins come in at a lot ~$3 for the whole lot, which is a lot less than you might pay elsewhere for a similar item. Overall, they are super nice and I really like the price. You can't find much on amazon for less than that price, and most of it wouldn't be as functional as these are.. Design - I really love the colorful map pin design. It adds a dimension of cuteness to the projects that I do, and I love it. Durability - They are very difficult to break or rupture, which is really nice.

I know it works, since I had a headache all day the next day.  This is a sign you are detoxing your body.

Oxygen kills yeast.  When yeast dies from the detox program, it releases toxins in your bloodstream.  These cause headaches, nausea, weakness, etc.  Add some Vit C powder to water and drink lots all day to flush them out.

{"reviewTxt": "These are the best thumb tacks ever. I bought these as a birthday present for my girlfriend. She really loves them and has been giving them away to her friends and family one by one. I can always rely on Lorell to provide me with high quality thumb tacks. Dont let the size fool you, these 5/16 inch steel thumb tacks can do all sorts of stuff. My personal favorite thing to use these tacks for is to... pin papers on a bulletin board. I know what you are thinking, but these sturdy little guys can ACTUALLY hold up a standard letter size paper that has dimensions of 8.5 inches by 11 inches. If you do the conversions you see that the surface area for such a paper is just over 0.06 square meters. Thus if it is 80g/m2 paper than the weight of a single sheet of paper comes to 4.83 grams, if it is 90g/m2 paper than the answer is 5.43 grams. These tacks have no problem holding up 5.43 grams. This is an unbelievably fantastic deal, dont pass it up. Dont even get me started about the design of the box. It is aesthetically pleasing in all ways, This box is mad out of thin, yet strong cardboard. It has a white base coat with black text. My favorite feature on the box is the red accent stripe because i feel it really ties together the whole design. Flawless! I was NOT paid to write this review, i was NOT given a discount, i am just a thumb tack enthusiast/collector who knows a lot about thumb tacks.

{"reviewTxt": "My boyfriend needed to get clean for a new job. After lots of searching, I found this product online as it seemed like the most reputable, though we were both quite nervous given the mixed reviews. In short, it worked! For some perspective, he's a fairly big guy who has smoked medicinally off and on for ten years, and almost daily for a couple consecutive months. To prepare for his drug test, he first abstained from toxins for a couple weeks. Three days prior he increased his water intake to about four liters per day. The night before his test, he used a home kit and tested positive for THC. The following morning, he first drank a little water, then the QCarbo over about fifteen minutes. (He said it tastes absolutely awful, but it's totally worth it.) Between drinking the QCarbo and going in for his test, he drank another 32 ounces of water. He took the test three hours after the detox. And the test came back negative! Hooray! So, for those who wish to use this, take the following steps VERY seriously, as they are absolutely vital for making this work: 1. Abstain as long as you can. Some say 24 hours, the directions say at least 48 hours, but the longer you can go without toxins in your system, the better. 2. Drink water. No, the directions don't mention drinking water at all. But based on every other successful testimonial, this seems to be the key! 3. Pay attention to timing. Don't drink the QCarbo on the way to your test and expect to pass. There will be a window of 1-4 hours after drinking the QCarbo in which you'll need to rehydrate, and take your test. 4. This is not for \"hard\" drugs. Just medicinal toxins.", "verifiedPurchase": true, "title": "It works if you abstain as long as possible, drink lots of water, and correctly time the detox/test.", "timestamp": "2016-10-17 10:40:31", "vine": false, "starRating": 5.0, "memberId": "A1OLTD2DFMCP3", "nComments": 0, "date": "on December 8, 2015", "productId": "B005VOZSP2", "id": "R3FZ9BWJVNKT8D", "helpful": [5]}

I drank that at room temp for the next 2 hours managing to get 1/2 gallon ingested before I had to step up to the plate. When the umpire (these guys are either really gay and love stareing at dicks all day or REALLY hate their jobs)  finished stareing at my junk/cupOpiss/teststicks he said I was free to go, passing without any suspicion.

{"reviewTxt": "I like that this product does what the name says; it makes you sweat! Like, for real, I mean it. I purchased this product specifically to help speed up the process to melt away the remaining layer of fat on my abs. It's incredibly frustrating when you can feel your abs underneath a layer of fat. So I decided to give this a try. I'm glad I did. For the price, the jar is worth the money. You get a lot of product for your money's worth. I've had this jar for about 6 weeks and it's still full. The consistency is that of a mixture of a slippery cream and oil. Anyways, the sweet sweat helps a lot. You can almost feel your body heating up. I more so use it for when I'm doing cardio. I do a lot of dance workouts and even after I'm finished working out, my body feels as if it's burning calories. Again, this product makes me SWEAT! This is specifically what I do. I make sure to drink green tea at least ten minutes before my workout. Then I apply the sweet sweat to my stomach, wrap my abdomen in saran wrap, and then use my sweet sweat belt. I've been doing this for about a month and a half now and I have lost about two inches on my waistline. This is no miracle fix. I have been eating mostly healthy, minus the Friday cheat meal, and I do not drink any other fluid except for water and green tea.

Sweat typically dries the when it hits the air, so with Sweet Sweat, the sweat sits on the oily surface and doesn't dry out as fast, thus giving the ILLUSION of more sweat.

{"reviewTxt": "I love this stuff. I discovered MagO7 watching Youtube, and even though I was not/am not doing the cleanse its a part of, I still wanted to try it out. My main goal in buying them was to find an alternative (aka cheaper and more consistent) to Oxypowder. I'd tried those in 2015, while they worked, they didn't consistently work and before you knew it, the bottle was gone. So I got these. Sooooo yeah. They do exactly as advertised. When I started taking them, they took maybe 2 or 3 days to get started. I attribute that to not drinking enough water. But when they kicked in? Clean out city!! Now in the video I watched on YT, the lady said that you wouldn't have to worry about that gottagogottagogottago feeling and it's more of an alert that it's time to go. That is very true! I've never felt I had to run to the bathroom. I was very concerned about that bc I take a bus and subway to work, and having bubble guts is not ideal. This product is like clockwork. I try to take them by 11 or 12 at night (I swim after work, so I get home much later and my stomach isn't empty \"early\") and btwn 9 and 12, I'm guaranteed something.  I definitely feel cleaner and the Mag helps a lot with bloat. Another great plus is that I have experienced no cramping or discomfort....and I currently take up to 6! I took these with me on vacation (a cruise) and was wary about taking them bc anyone that's been on a cruise knows most of the day is spent touring, swimming, doing excursions, etc. I was in the Caribbean, so depending on where we were, bathrooms either weren't around or weren't the best.  I was very nervous, but I knew that eating rich food on the ship and then trying local foods (although fresh) could back me up. I can report that I had ZERO issues. I would take them when I came in for the night, around 1 or 2 am) and by 8 or 9, they worked. OK, so now that I'm on my 2nd bottle, I am going to try to scale down to 4 or 5, to make them last longer, however I have noticed (today is the first day of a lower dose) that I am still waiting to go. I said above that by noon, I've usually gone at least once, but it is currently 11:55. I might end up going back to six and then just re-upping monthly. As for the taste, YUCK. Sweet is all I can describe it as, but it's not a good sweet.  I can't swallow pills past a certain size, so I open the capsules and dump them in a drink. First, they will thicken any liquid you put them in. I started w/various juices (blackberry, mango, white grape), but on the cruise, I tried it w/the free lemonade and that was the best combo to mask the taste. I guess the tartness balances it out. So now I take it w/Minute Maid. I should probably take it w/water, but the only way I know to get it down is with something that covers the taste. Try them! I've turned someone on to them already. As long as they work for me, I will continue to take them.", "verifiedPurchase": true, "title": "Does the job!

{"reviewTxt": "Devotional image from Rick Warren \u201cWe capture every thought and make it give up and obey Christ\u201d (2 Corinthians 10:5b NCV). Here\u2019s the secret to temptation: Don\u2019t fight it. Just refocus. Whatever you resist persists. Did you know that in the Bible, not once are you told to resist temptation? We are told to resist the Devil, and that\u2019s a whole different issue. But the key to overcoming temptation is not to push back. It\u2019s to change your focus. Whatever gets your attention gets you. The battle for sin always starts in the mind. That\u2019s why the Bible says in Psalm 119:6, \u201cThinking about your commands will keep me from doing some foolish thing\u201d (CEV). Why? Because if you\u2019re thinking about God\u2019s truth, you\u2019re not thinking about the less important stuff. It\u2019s true in every single area of life \u2014 good or bad. If you focus on godly things, it\u2019s going to pull you that direction. If you focus on the stuff that\u2019s at the movies and in magazines, it\u2019s going to pull you that direction. Whatever you focus on gets your attention. Whatever gets your attention is going to get you.

{"reviewTxt": "This stuff will definitely do as it says, make you sweat.  But there are a few caveats.  First and foremost is that it is greasy.  I would not wear my favorite Lulu work-out clothes when using this stuff.  It's not as greasy as like vaseline, but it's in the same ballpark.  So everything you touch after applying will have that shiny sheen to it, even the container itself when closing the lid and yes I did wipe my hands on paper towels after applying, but your hands still have that slippery sheen too.  The other thing I is that the directions say, \"do not rub it into the skin\".  So you basically just apply it like a thin coat which leaves you shiny.

Made coffee sat at my laptop and I got that feeling I needed to go to the bathroom, (hint-DO NOT WAIT) went to the bathroom and whoosh.  And all done.

Now I take 5 capsules two days in a row about every 2-3 weeks. And I still eliminate every day, so it does not interfere with your normal body functions as some cleaners or laxatives will.

{"reviewTxt": "I was a very skeptical customer at the time before I purchased the Super Colon Cleanse. Like most people, I read both positive and negative reviews of the product. The negative reviews I read such as: a waste of money, didn't work for me, a waste of my time, etc.... The positive reviews said something completely different such as: be careful, watch the intake amount, it works really well, it's explosive, etc........ I thought to myself, \"what the hell, it's cheap enough\", I'll give it a shot.  OK!!!!! 1st of all, my wife is AFRAID of the product because since she started taking it she CAN'T get off the toilet. It works better than anything she or I have ever taken before. The main reason why today I am posting this product review, for 5 days now I have been taking 4 pills everynight before I go to bed. On the 6th day (today), while I was at work, I thought I had to PASS GAS ONLY!!!!, but to my surprise I s**t myself!!!! I would like to say that the people reviewing this product and advising others to have NOOOOOO plans, adhere to that advice. Clear your schedule and request PTO time at work, you are going to get to know Your Throne very well. If you are a couple taking this together, make sure you have 2 bathrooms available....... IT IS THAT SERIOUS!!!!!! If you are a large family, do not allow the whole family to partake in the use of this product all at once.....there will be a lot of bowel cleansing taking place. I know this review may seem funny, but we thought the same thing in reading the reviews before purchase, we laughed until we cried at a few, but they were telling the TRUTH.........and we are too...... If you are experiencing constipation in any form, chronic or basic constipation, and you have exasperated all other options such as: mineral oil, stool softeners, magnesium, beano, metamucil, fibercon, etc....TRY SUPER COLON CLEANSE.

If you focus on godly things, it\u2019s going to pull you that direction. If you focus on the stuff that\u2019s at the movies and in magazines, it\u2019s going to pull you that direction. Whatever you focus on gets your attention. Whatever gets your attention is going to get you.

{"reviewTxt": "I took this purchase very seriously, as it was my only hope to land a very badly needed job. I was grateful for the thorough reviews and knew I would pay it forward with my experience. This will be long and detailed for those like me who leave no stone unturned. Skip to the end if you want. I used THC basically every single day for 8 years. Usually just a little at bedtime with occasional overindulgences. I lost my job and stopped immediately as I set up interviews. I received a job offer requiring a drug test.of course, and the test was scheduled at 10am, 18 days after my last puff. I should add, THC was my only concern. I don't use anything else so can give any info on effectiveness for other substances. I also purchased the 15 pack of test strips on Amazon for $10. Highly suggest doing the same. I was still showing positive on the morning of the test. After reading nearly every long review here, I decided to start drinking water at 730am, then the tropical flavor qcarbo at 8am. This was not enough time for my body. For starters, it was tough to drink so early on an empty stomach. I tried pretzels to help keep it down, but wound up vomiting at 830 just after my last sip. I didn't vomit a lot, but still. I chugged the bottle of water after, but didn't feel much urge to pee. I kept forcing myself to go anyway, and testing each time. I knew that drinking a lot of water had been making my tests show negative, which they were at this time. However, I didn't have the urge to goany times like I read I was supposed to. By the time I got to the lab, I did have to go. My pee was pretty normal in color. When i got home, THEN I had to pee constantly for a couple hours. 5 days later the new job calls to say my test came back \"negative but diluted\" and I needed to retest. I attributed this to the vitamins not having fully gone through my system into my urine, which I assume happens during the many urinations after drinking. I scheduled my next test for 1pm, at 28 days no using. I was still testing positive that morning. On this day, I ate a small bagel at 7am and had my coffee. At 9 am I drank 16 oz water. 930, started drinking the tropical flavor again, finished at 10am. I drank 32 oz water between 1030-11, then nothing until after the test. I peed about Six times between 11-1230. Each of these tested negative. This time for peace of mind, I brought a test strip to the lab with me, and checked my sample myself before turning it in. Negative. The color was again normal. This time, I passed no problem. Basically, don't smoke as soon as you are aware of the test, and don't smoke again until you know you passed. Buy test strips and qcarbo32. FINISH the drink at least two hours before the test. Fill the bottle with water and drink that too. This all took me about an hour. I suggest eating something light earlier on, because it is nauseating. Inspect and test each time you pee, should be about 5 times before the test. Faint lines are negative (I tested a non smoker and their line was faint also) Do not drink after you do this, because the urine will be diluted to the lab. This does not clean your system. This drink literally just disguises diluted urine. 16oz water+qcarbo32+32oz water+2-3 hours=clean up to another hour or two.", "title": "Works if you do it correctly", "timestamp": "2016-10-17 10:40:59", "verifiedPurchase": true, "vine": false, "memberId": "A2CCKW1KX52DHM", "starRating": 4.0, "nComments": 0, "date": "on October 15, 2016", "id": "RQDC8WFVU94XK", "productId": "B005VOZSP2"}

Since my gym is highly air conditioned I never really got a good sweat and I was constantly cooled off. I applied this just to my chest and did my normal routine for the day. I noticed I have more blood flow going to that area and I was getting a better pump overall but do the arctic like AC system I still could not a get a good sweat. Legs however I did not have problem dripping sweat and my shorts had looked like they had fallen in the pool. I used this in the sauna and worked miracles. I came out of the sauna looking like I had just showered. Pros: Makes you sweat Gives better blood flow Easy to apply Smells pretty good Cons: After my shirts dry from the gym they seem greasy from the cream When using the cream in the tub I never fully wash it off and my hands sweat and I cannot grip weights as well Really need to scrub when you are in the shower to get it the rest off All in all I think this product is great and my next step is to get a waist trimmer and see what happens. However if you want to try this product I say go for it but make sure you try it out in different conditions so you know how your body reacts to it. I have to get my heart rate above 143 before I get a good sweat going. I do not use it when I lift but I do when I do cardio and legs and it works amazing. If you do body combat or crossfit this is right up you alley. After I am out of the cream I am definitely getting the stick just because of the sweaty hands issue and it will be more of an even spread. If you are thinking about trying it.

I do recomend that you take them 2 hours before or after other medicines you might be taking; it just makes everything more effective.

{"reviewTxt": "This cleanser was recommended by the author of the \"10 Day Green Smoothie Cleanse\", to help those who weren't having productive BMs during the cleanse. I was one of those people. I typically shy away from, or don't trust products such as these because of the painful cramping that some give. This is definitely different.  When it's time to \"go\", you just know. There's is little \"movement\" in your stomach and you know it's time. I like the fact that you don't cramp up, but there's a small risk of not reading your symptoms correctly. The reason for the 4 stars... The time frame in which the pills are supposed to work was never the same. The directions tell you to take 3-5 pills on an empty stomach before bedtime, with 8-12 ounces of water. The desired effect is supposed to occur after your good night's sleep. I took three pills and followed the other directions.  The first time I used it, it took 8 hours to work. So, the next two times I took them, I expected the same. Instead, the second time, I was up about 4 hours into the night, and the third time, it was working after 3 hours. It was frustrating to lose sleep and kind of worry about getting back into bed. I'm glad the stuff worked, but it was hard to gauge the time frame, and plan accordingly. I would definitely recommend the product, but would ask you to be aware of some of the quirks.", "verifiedPurchase": true, "title": "Works...with some quirks", "timestamp": "2016-10-17 10:41:02", "vine": false, "starRating": 4.0, "memberId": "AO4VMYHTQJOMU", "nComments": 0, "date": "on August 1, 2014", "productId": "B000PKEJR0", "id": "R2B8YWCLE3IJHX", "helpful": [6]}

{"reviewTxt": "Thank you Amazon Prime shipping! Sweet sweat is some sweet stuff for workouts. I have been using Albolene for over two years and don't get me wrong it did a good job with my workouts. However, I wanted to see if SS was better than Albolene and if it caused me to sweat more. Once I received it I immediately gave it a try and did the same type of exercise regimen that I did when I used the Albolene. Keep in mind everybody is different so everybody will not get the same sweat results when using certain products or doing certain exercises. However, for me SS created more sweat than the Albolene with a 45 minute cardio workout. You can't go wrong with either product but I do like the SS better than Albolene and for the price of SS i'm glad it provided the results that it did.

{"reviewTxt": "Bought this for my Father. He really needed it badly. He had months worth of back up. It looks like he was wearing a backpack backwards. Trust me spare tire doesn't do him justice.

His huge gut has since turned into a regular fat guy beer gut, instead of a rock. This stuff works really well. Also it wasn't just a lot of diarrhea, it was just a lot of regular poops. Sorry I'm trying not to be gross but, if you're reading this review you want details right? It also worked pretty quickly just going by the directions on the bottle, it started working within 48 hours. He said that there wasn't a lot of pain or cramps. Not even any constipation. He said there was just a little at first but, not too bad. After the first few days just several regular BMs per day. After the first week and a half it was back to business as usual. His spare tire was gone. So I would recommend this to anyone. I should mention that the reason It got this bad is because he has to take a lot of narcotic pain medicine for back pain. It has mostly stayed gone but, anyone that takes prescription pain medicine knows it causes constipation like this. It has come back a little bit but that's because he stopped taking it.

Now I'm certain they're what work for me. I am on the 5 pill routine & usually have one large movement in the morning. That is it but that's enough for me. I still have to be careful about fiber. Naturally having been constipated a lot I've tried fiber. I've come to realize fiber supplements, psyllium (and definitely bentonite clay) aggravate the problem even more since my digestion is very sluggish. I have noticed when I add fiber while using this it doesn't work as well. This is where Mag07 comes in. Unlike a lot of other supplements it is not a bulking agent. It doesn't work by trying to bulk up your waste. It seems to dissolve it instead. I can occassionally hear/feel a slight gurgling which is all that old junk being dissolved I guess.

Something happened while we're eating, I can't finished my food, coz' I felt that I have to go to the bathroom ASAP. So told my husband that I can't finish my food and we got to go home right away after eating. And whollla\u2026.went straight to the bathroom when we got home, and for the first time I felt everything went out of my tract and it gave me a very comforting feelings. I felt very clean after that day, and been using this Colon Cleanse regularly and it does what I expected. Better try this friends!!

{"reviewTxt": "Okay so I bought this product because the reviews looked promising and so I decided to bite the bullet and try it out. I just finished a round of antibiotics and my Doctor failed to mention to take probiotics after taking them and so I've been having some serious gastrointestinal problems because of said antibiotics like constipation and random bloating and all that good stuff. I started off with 4 pills every night but after the second day and no results I was ready to give up and call it a fake. The directions say to take it every morning and every night so I did do that with a whole glass of water (very important, do it) and on the third day I was going to the bathroom! Now it wasn't like how the other reviewers are claiming where you're hugging the toilet but I actually preferred that. I wanted something to clean me out the natural way and not have to take some laxative that would only work that one time and I would go back to the same bloating and constipation. I made the mistake of using this product for 14 days when I remembered in the instructions it tells you not to take it more than 10 days (oops!) Anyway, all in all it's an awesome product that really works. Just don't give up like me and continue at it and remember to always drink a full glass of water (8-10oz) with it.", "verifiedPurchase": true, "title": "I'm a believer!", "timestamp": "2016-10-17 10:41:09", "vine": false, "starRating": 5.0, "memberId": "A1FYHOGQFCPLRT", "nComments": 0, "date": "on August 21, 2015", "productId": "B000KPO9QG", "id": "R31GIGQ4TM5UTV", "helpful": [15]}
{"reviewTxt": "Sorry but this colon cleanse clogged me up.  I had to do several enemas to push out the garbage this colon cleanse was releasing.

I feel it does what it says but I gave it 2 stars for those whose digestion is not working so well.  If I do take it again, I will be juicing and drinking more water than I was drinking.

I quit about two weeks prior to my test and I'm about 180 pounds, 5'9\", a little beer gut if I'm being honest.  As soon as I quit I started to up my intake of water quite a bit compared to my average day.  Worked out about 5 times in those two weeks.  Took 500 MG Niacin Pills for about 5 days twice a day.  Took the test this morning and drank a whole bottle of this stuff prior to the test, taste is awful but what do you expect really out of something like this.  After I drank it I filled it back up with water and drank the whole bottle again(filled with water of course).  My test is definitely going off to a lab because it was pre employment test and that's what I gathered from what they were saying at the place I went to.  Anyways in the past I've used drinks like this that I paid five times the amount for from places like GNC, so it's my first time trying this particular kind of drink.

Sometimes it wouldn't even occur after 36 hours. I stopped and used a simple method like simply drinking warm water when you wake up on a empty stomach and immediately after 15 min I had to go to the bathroom.

{"reviewTxt": "So here's the scoop. Thanks to undiagnosed celiac disease I have always had bathroom troubles. Until I find a raw vegan diet that has me going 5 times a day with joy and gratitude. Flash forward to last year when I decided to mess with my diet. No amount of fiber or cleanses got me back to my poo happy days. In fact I wasn't going that much at all. I yearned to poop a lot again so I tried everything that worked for me before. I didn't realize I may be blocked, I just felt like maybe I wasn't doing everything right. Maybe I just needed a colon cleanse. We then come to August 2016 when I buy a colon cleanse that I have used with great results many times before. It made me go, in the past, 5 times a day with joy and gratitude. Day one, I feel full and bloated which hadn't happened before. Never mind. The poo is coming. It took me 5 days to realize that the colon cleanse wasn't coming out no matter how many enemas were applied to the problem. I was fat, bloated and in much pain. As this product had worked so well in the past, I realized that I obviously am blocked. Which is an issue when one doesn't like medical care. I was in so much pain last week I didn't even want to eat or drink because nothing was coming out. So I searched online and found this. and immediately took 6 capsules before bed. I am happy to say I see small progress. I went yesterday twice. Took 8 last night and woke up to a poop, and feel less like I have stones in my system. I worked 12 hours yesterday as a server with no issues, so I wouldn't worry if you are used to stomach issues. It literally just moves things along. You may feel \"crappy\" at first as when poop stays in your system, it can cause joint pain and migranes and this product stirs all of it up. I will update as I keep taking but this worked when nothing else did and took away my horrible pain. Just up the pills if it doesn't work at first.

{"reviewTxt": "I forget exactly where I even heard/read about this product; some random blog I think.  Since reaching menopause, I think my most Google'd inquiries had to do with constipation.  There were times I'd eaten so much fiber during the day, my stomach would bloat and cramp. I added fiber drinks and fiber tablets... oh, they would help, of course, but I just wasn't satisfied with the results.  I prefer to have a \"daily routine\", not an \"every other day routine\", or even \"every third day\".  On top of that, I noticed that even with the added fiber, things were kind of \"rocky\", if you catch my drift.  So... time to try something else. I still use a nightly fiber drink, and still ensure that I eat my veggies daily, and still drink as much water as I can.  But now I've added Mag O7 to my daily routine.  What a huge difference this has made!  I wasn't willing to start with 5 and work my way down, because I had visions of frequent bathroom visits the next day, so I started with 2 capsules for the first two days.  Well, that didn't quite impress me, so I upped it to 3 capsules for the next two days (before bedtime and with adequate/recommended water). That was better.  I then tried 4 capsules, and that was a bit too much, so I sort of rocked between 3 and 2 capsules for several days, then sort of stayed on 2 capsules for a while... I tried 1 capsule, but that seemed too low for me, so back up to 2.  And now 2 capsules is pretty much my standard daily regimen.  There are still times I feel I need more or less, but typically, it's 2 per day. No bloating, no cramping, no \"rocky\" events, no runs to the bathroom... although there have been a couple of times I couldn't trust myself to pass gas, but those were very seldom, and did not stop me from using this product daily since it arrived.

{"reviewTxt": "I am an occasionally heavy smoker, meaning I smoke a few days during the week at night before bed and heavily on the weekends. I'm 6'0, 180 lbs, 11% body fat. I smoked a few bleezies Monday night with friends and on Wednesday got notification of a drug screen for a new job on the upcoming Monday. I stopped smoking immediately and ordered this product with guaranteed delivery for Saturday. I drank a gallon of water a day up to the day of the test and ate healthy like I usually do because I lift weights regularly. On Monday the day of the test I woke up at 8am, the test was scheduled for 4pm. I drank a gallon of water throughout the hours of 8am to 2pm, then at 2 I drank this entire drink(it took about 20 minutes to finish, the aftertaste is horrid but well worth it), I had some slight dizziness and stomach cramping which led to slight diarrhea but nothing severe. After finishing the detox drink I drank (2) 16oz bottles of water and urinated about 3-4 times heavily before leaving my house for the clinic. I started having to pee again on my drive there but HOLD IT as hard as you can so when you go during the test there's a lot that comes out. When you start peeing, pee in the toilet for about 4-5 seconds then hit the cup mid stream until it's filled up just enough then finish in the toilet.

{"reviewTxt": "I have been waiting for my chance to write this review for many years! And the time is now. The \"oxygen\" approach is the one I can stick with. As somebody who had an intense parasitic attack in Mozambique which effectively wiped out my body's ability to digest food normally, I have suffered from chronic constipation for 4 years. I have run through the list of possible remedies: - Stimulant laxatives (create dependency and yucky cramping) - Stool softener pills (not strong enough) - Fiber supplement (can help manage things when one is very careful with diet--but is rough once I became too impacted) - Probiotics (no noticeable assistance) - High-fiber foods (always a good idea, but one slice of pizza does me in) - Magnesium & zinc (apparently I didn't have a deficiency) And then one day I was just skimming the net for new ideas for laxatives since I had grown so upset not feeling normal and having a bloated stomach. I saw an ad for a premium priced version of this product and purchased it reluctantly ($40 for 120 pills). And just like the product under review, I was happy to find that with 4 pills before bed, I'd wake up with the feeling of needing to relieve myself. Basically, this product seems to liquify your stool and get it really moving. And, the great thing is that if i take a decent size dose (4 pills), I'll be somewhat regular with non-liquid stool for about two days, and then I'll do another dose. I've been doing this for about 3 months now and haven't noticed any fading effect (as the stimulants do--since they are muscle stimulants). I don't feel pain, no blood, no yucky side effects that I can put my finger on. Just the somewhat bothersome liquid stool problem--but heck, I'll take that over the bloating and bulging any day of the week. I finally feel like I can eat my occasional pizza or ice cream sundae (high dairy, low digestibility) and not do myself in for a week of yucky constipation. Highly recommend if you need something with a strong kick.", "verifiedPurchase": true, "title": "A long-needed effective remedy -- It keeps things moving!", "timestamp": "2016-10-17 10:41:33", "vine": false, "starRating": 5.0, "memberId": "A3055E4D6180O9", "nComments": 0, "date": "on November 17, 2012", "productId": "B000PKEJR0", "id": "R1DDAN44M4FYSM", "helpful": [10]}

Then, after drinking a cup of hot tea, I was ready to run in the Race! I got to the 'Starter's Line' on my Royal Throne and ran the Race with ease. I ran only one Race , which wasn't crampy or uncomfortable and the Mag07's let me run the Race at my own pace, it wasn't bossy and pushing everything out the way like the Salt Water Flush which also forces one to run more than one Race that morning within 10-15mins of each other hehehe!  I will continue to use this product because it isn't bossy, it lets you run the Race with comfort and ease.  I even gave 5, the first night, to my teenage son and he even slept through the night and ran his own Race when he got ready and wasn't bullied.

{"reviewTxt": "My 3 year old started doing what is called poop with holding . We have tried everything to try to get her to stop but nothing was working until we started her on MagO7. This is for adults and mostly used for bowel cleansing and you should discuss this with your doctor before trying it on a child but it has her to the point she can't always stop the urge to go. She is still trying to hold it but now she is going every couple of days rather than a full week without pooping. It isn't as traumatic for her and this is helping her. You have to slowly introduce it into their diet depending on how long it has been since they have used the potty. Normally you will also need to figure out how much you actually need to give because there is no dosage for a child. But if they are like my daughter and being close to having to go to the hospital because she is hurting herself fighting the need to go and almost completely impacted... you may want to give at least 1 to 2 capsules. I have to hide it and not let her see me open the capsule and put it in her juice or flavored water. Applesauce works great too.  Our next step was the hospital because I wasn't going to give her another enema ever again, it was so dramatic and traumatic and it physically hurt as much as mentally because of all the fighting to hold her still  and give it to her...It hurt me so much to do this and not be able to fully explain to her what was happening, I couldn't do it myself again. I knew if she didn't go soon she could hurt herself internally.  Since the MagO7, my stress level is way down. She isn't going every day, but that is okay because she is going more than once a week. She is back to eating and playing and being normal. Please remember to discuss this with your doctor before deciding to give it to a youngster but it did do the trick for us.

{"reviewTxt": "menusearch Listen Now Charisma News -\u00a0+ 25 Really Weird Things Said to Pastors and Other Church Leaders8:00AM EDT 10/16/2015Thom S. Rainer ShareTweetEmailMore Pastors and church leaders sometimes hear the strangest quips. (Lightstock) Few people are truly aware of the constant requests, complaints, and criticisms pastors and other church leaders receive. I must admit, however, I was surprised when I asked church leaders on Twitter to share some of the more unusual comments they have received. I was first surprised at how many responded. But I was most surprised at the really strange things people tell pastors and other church leaders. Many of the comments related to using the Bible too much or to being too evangelistic. I should make those a blog post by themselves. I narrowed my selection to 25, but it could have been much higher. I left off many great comments to keep this post manageable. I've only made minor wording changes to some of these. For the most part, I received these quotes just as you are seeing them. The parenthetical words after each comment represent my off-the-cuff commentary. 1. \"We need a small group for cat lovers.\"\u00a0(I guess they could serve Meow Mix as a snack.) 2. \"You need to change your voice.\"\u00a0(Yes ma'am. I'll try to have that done by next week.) 3. \"Our expensive coffee is attracting too many hipsters.\"\u00a0(Yep. You don't want too many of those hipsters in your church.) 4. \"Preachers who don't wear suits and ties aren't saved. It's in the Bible.\u00a0(I should have known that's what Jesus and Paul wore.) 5. \"Your socks are distracting.\"\u00a0(I understand. I'll stop wearing socks.) 6. \"You shouldn't make people leave the youth group after they graduate.\"\u00a0(It's going to get really weird by the time they turn 70 years old.) 7. \"I don't like the color of the towels in the women's restroom.\"\u00a0(I don't understand. They match the towels in the men's restroom.) 8. \"We need to start attracting more normal people at church.\"\u00a0(So, you will be leaving the church, I presume.) 9. \"I developed cancer because you don't preach from the KJV.\"\u00a0(Major medical announcement! New carcinogen discovered!) 10. \"Your wife never compliments me about my hair or dress.\"\u00a0(There could be a reason for that.) 11. \"Not enough people signed up for the church golf tournament. You have poor leadership skills.\"\u00a0(I'm so sorry. I expected more since most of the deacons play golf on Sunday morning) 12. \"I think you are trying to preach caffeineism.\"\u00a0(Probably Reformed theology with an extra kick.) advertisement 13. \"If Jesus sang from the red hymnals, why can't we?\"\u00a0(I think you are mistaken. He sang from blue hymnals.) 14.\u00a0(To a pastor who married interracially).\u00a0\"You are living in sin. You shouldn't be married to each other.\"\u00a0(That one is not worthy of commentary.) 15. \"I don't like the brand of donuts in the foyer.\"\u00a0(It's better than Meow Mix.) 16. \"You didn't wrap the hot dogs in bacon for the church picnic.\"\u00a0(I understand that one. Bacon rules.) 17. \"You shouldn't drink water when you preach.\"\u00a0(At least not simultaneously.) 18. \"The toilet paper is on the wrong way in the ladies restroom. It's rolled under.\"\u00a0(My guess is that it is still functional.) 19. \"Why don't you ever preach on Tim Tebow?\"\u00a0(Be patient. I will be preaching a six-week expository series on him in the fall.) 20. \"You don't have ashtrays in the fellowship hall.\"\u00a0(Yes we do. They are right next to the spittoons for your chewing tobacco.) 21. \"Did you see me waving in the back of the worship center? You preached too long. It was time to eat!\"\u00a0(Who needs a clock when I have you?) 22. \"The eggs were not scrambled enough at the senior adult breakfast.\"\u00a0(We thought you could jump up and down after you ate them to finish the job.) 23. \"You don't look at our side of the worship center enough when you preach.\"\u00a0(That's because you are on that side.) 24. \"We are leaving the church because you have a red cross on the building. That's the color of the devil.\"\u00a0(I understand. It's in the same verse that describes his pitchfork and horns.) 25. \"Your sermon needed more calories.\"\u00a0(OK. I'll feed it one of those donuts in the foyer.) Pastors and other church leaders must have great patience and strength. They are faced with these and many other comments and demands every day.

{"reviewTxt": "Ok, I've been reading all of the hype about colon cleansing in combination with Garcinia Cambogia and I must admit, I'm seeing a difference already and so has my boyfriend. My stomach has shrunk a bit and my clothes are fitting a tad better now. Sometimes all someone needs to see is a small difference to remain motivated and now I'm motivated to continue. I'm about 50 pounds overweight and my health has suffered from knee pain to back aches.  My blood pressure has also increased due to the added weight. I don't want to get diabetes and thank God I didn't have it as per my last check up. One thing about weight, it just seems to just sneak up on you slowly and then after being overweight you can't stand to look in a mirror any longer. Your clothes fit sloppier and you begin to hide behind bigger clothes. You love the winters more and you dread the summers because being overweight is  more noticeable then. When I told my boyfriend that I was going to lose weight, he replied, \"I'm so proud of you. I wanted to say something to you before but you probably would have been offended.\"  Well he was correct. I would have been offended, but he would have been correct. He loves me and just wants me to be healthy to live happy ever after with him.  I'm making a move because I want to take my health back. I want to look good for myself first and then for him.  When we go out, he has to walk slower because of me. When we're walking up the stairs, he also slows down for me. I'm totally out of breath when I reach the top. He's about 6 yrs. older than I am and health-wise, I feel 10 years older than him due to the added weight. I want to feel better and perhaps I could get off of the meds I'm currently taking. Let me also add, this will keep you in the bathroom. Trust me. It's a great thing where I work, no matter what floor I'm on, I'm no more than 50 feet from multiple bathrooms. This product appears to be a bit unpredictable because sometimes a bowel movement can happen at any time.  I've experienced some cramping while taking this, but it's not enough to get me to stop now that I am seeing results. There was a time I was on my way home and when I got in the house I only had time to drop my bag and take off my coat before running to the bathroom.  Weekends are fine because due to the cold weather, I'm mostly home anyway.  Because of the unpredictability, I will not take this if I know I will be going on a long trip (or even a short one for that matter).  I will stop completely at least a few days before the trip.  I began by taking the recommended dose. During the work week, I may need to cut back on the pills a bit. All I can say is that this stuff really cleans you out.

{"reviewTxt": "Pros This product along with the Sweet Waist Trimmer will definitely make you sweat along your waistline; especially after a good workout.  The oil is very light-weight and you only need a small amount to cover your waistline.

I've discontinued using the cream. Therefore, my suggestion is to order the Sweet Waist Trimmer which comes with a sample order of the Sweet Sweat cream.

{"reviewTxt": "I was using this for a while, but it's really just another laxative, and long-term use of laxatives is not good for you. I could never get the dose right. Not enough, and nothing would happen. Too many, and you know what happens. After twenty-five years of chronic constipation I finally found something that got me pretty much back to normal. Kefir. It's sort of like yogurt, only it contains a dozen or more varieties of good bacteria. I found the homemade stuff is even better than the commercial stuff like Lifeway. You can buy Kefir grains culture online at eBay. I buy a gallon of milk every four days and make a quart of the stuff and drink it every day. I finally have good bacteria in my stomach again. I have no constipation or the opposite issues anymore. If you've tried everything else, try Kefir. UPDATE - Even Kefir stopped working after awhile.

{"reviewTxt": "I finally found an eating plan that worked for me--intermittent fasting. What does that have to do with these little caps? Well, I thought I was going to have to abandon this eating plan because the fasting days caused my digestive system to basically stop. After a few months I finally reached a point where the ol' system hadn't budged for an entire week. Talk about discomfort. Also, I began having dizzy spells that would ruin any plans I had for the day. Long story short, I was miserable and about to give up this plan I loved. Then I found these guys! Miracle caps! I read tons of Amazon reviews and several people warned that you should start slow and see how you react, so the first night I took two and anxiously waited for results. NOTHING. The next night I took three and thought for sure it'd work this time. Nope. The third night, pretty desperate at this point, I took the full five caplets. The next day, FINALLY, I had relief. Absolutely no cramping. I just had to go. I've tried eating more fiber and I've tried laxatives. Fiber doesn't work, and laxatives give me horrible cramps. In comparison, these pills are a godsend. Since then, I have found what works best for me is to take two caplets in every morning. Taking them before bed doesn't seem to work as well for me. I will say that since they work so well, sometimes if I know I have meetings all morning, etc., I'll wait to take them till noon, because they work pretty quickly for me. Occasionally I'll forget to take them and end up in discomfort for a few days, and in those cases I sometimes take an extra cap before bed, or three in the morning. I try not to do it too often since on occasion I've taken too many and ended up in the bathroom a little too much. But overall, they have made everything so much better. I always had an irregular system, even before I began the intermittent fasting plan, and these pills have made everything so much better.", "title": "Thank god I found these.", "timestamp": "2016-10-17 10:42:01", "verifiedPurchase": true, "vine": false, "memberId": "A3PR8KP8SYD8IB", "starRating": 5.0, "nComments": 0, "date": "on October 28, 2015", "id": "RQAOG8S2JR267", "productId": "B000PKEJR0"}

{"reviewTxt": "I used this cleanse in addition to a few other precautions. to be fair, I was testing negative using single panel at home tests which i also found on amazon (these are what gave me the MOST confidence going into my pre-employment screening). For that reason, and being a fit, 5'5\" woman, i didn't feel the need to drink the whole bottle (which is meant for extreme toxicity and larger body mass). I knew my fallback plan was dilution method, so I started with a trial by consuming 1/4 of the bottle the evening before. I wanted to void a few times and understand how it affected the color of my urine. Anything containing concentrations of B2 makes you pee mountain dew so watch out. The day of the test, i drank water throughout the night (always do), voided a couple times in the morning, then switched to drinking the remaining 3/4 bottle of cleanse over the next hour up until 20 mins before the test. I also drank water throughout to help dilute my sample - this would both assure that negative result and lighten up the B2 color so it was believable color. It worked like a charm. Passed the test and everything appeared normal.

{"reviewTxt": "A little background about me (be forewarned, this is blunt). I am in my twenties, a former athlete and currently not in the best shape of my life. After stepping on the scale and finding out I was over 20 pounds overweight, I still didn't try and \"fix\" it. After I noticed how sluggish, lethargic and uninterested I was becoming, still didn't \"fix\" it. I had the slow metabolism, constant bloated stomach and as for bowel movements, if I had ONE every three days or so, it was the norm. Finally, I had the wake-up call needed from a nine-year old. \"How can you be twenty- (something) and be so slow?\" Ouch. Long story short, I researched and found out that my current state of being could really, definitly kill me. One of the things I learned was how necessary a \"reset\" to the body was before losing weight. I bought the Super Colon Cleanse and on the first day, I noticed an immediate change. I highly reccomend not taking a high number st first, see how your body reacts to it. I started taking just one after meals and then moved up to two and found that it was the perfect number for me, (taking three was overkill). Also, drink water, as much as you can. I once took the capsules without any water whatsover the entire day and got hit with a major case of nausea and queasiness. Green tea was also a nice aid while taking these capsules, it helped \"settle\" my stomach. After the two weeks, said stomach was down! No bloated feelings and I was having normal bowel movements. This definitly helps if you're someone on the path to getting healthy but be warned that this not a diet pill and should NOT be taken longer than the reccomended time. Of course, if you go back to very unhealthy habits, you will set back the positive results of these capsules. Take things slowly, be patient and do your research.

{"reviewTxt": "I waited 3 weeks to post a review, because a few people have written reviews after 1 or 2 uses. These reviews, are for lack of a better term, useless. Everyone is different, and a person with closed pores that retains more water, will take a few days, or even a week to start seeing the results. It took a week for me to see results in the under arm areas and neck areas. I ordered a neoprene belt, from McDavid, and used it over my waist with a layer of \"Sweet Sweat(tm)\" around my waist. After 20 minutes of running or cardio of any kind, I take the belt off and my waist line is just beaded with tons of sweat. I also tried Sweet Sweat with a \"Kutting Weight\" Sauna Shirt that I ordered last week, and it works miracles. I put the sweet sweat all over my upper body, put on a t-shirt, then the sauna shirt over that. Work out for 45 minutes, doing WHATEVER and the suit heats up your core, while the sweet sweat maximized the amout of sweat output. I definately recommend this product for people who have fat under their arms, or around their waist and they want to drain/trim those areas.", "verifiedPurchase": true, "title": "Good stuff - works", "timestamp": "2016-10-17 10:42:13", "vine": false, "starRating": 4.0, "memberId": "A2YM8PM09547IP", "nComments": 0, "date": "on October 26, 2011", "productId": "B001EN14CA", "id": "R2ETWZPEZC8VXZ", "helpful": [171]}

Urinated about 3 times, another home test. Strong negative, but my pee looked like nuclear waste. It would probably glow under a black light. Urinated another 2 or 3 times and left for the test. Did official test about 1.5 hrs after drinking the q carbo, still had highlighter pee. The tech actually told me she can tell I take my vitamins and that must be why I'm in such great shape (I'm a very very thin female). Sent it off to the lab, and will update when I have results.

Then I would take the pills (all 5) and drink A TON of water with it.  I know people would say why drink that much water right before bed, well take the pills at least a hour prior to bed, this way you can expel some of the water you just drank.

{"reviewTxt": "I'm not saying the product doesn't work, I'm saying in a mad rush for 'miracles' people assign expectations or ideas.  I read a lot of reviews for people that didn't see noticeable weight loss and found it unfavorable as a result, but that wasn't why I was interested in Sweet Sweat.  I know a little bit about weight loss having been clinically obese at one time.  Having lost that weight I still carry around a little loose skin for my trouble and found several reviews about it helping tone that up a little, even a couple of claims it helps with stretch marks, so I gave it a try. I've been using it for about 6 weeks now and it has lived up to that expectation.  The \"problem\" areas that the product refers to do respond in modest increments.  The slightest of unflattering bulges are less noticeable in clothes and my skin just feels almost as good as coming out of a sauna.  Heat is applied and kind of feels like skin opens up and this is especially true if you use it in areas you don't commonly sweat much in.  I've even had residue left on my fingers before and they get a tingle like the skin opens up; they don't sweat, I'm not crazy, but there is definitely a reaction.  As far as stretch marks I've seen no change there. As bonus point having shed so much weight I'm pretty familiar with the inside of a gym so I know endorphin highs pretty well.  This does help induce that.  I'll go on my lunch hour to get a little workout in, so nothing too invested, but I can get that pumped energetic feeling to follow me through the rest of the day.  This isn't a full proof situation, it doesn't happen every time so I stress that I CAN do it, but its definitely easier when I use Sweet Sweat.  That is an extra tip for people that look to get those endorphin highs. In a nutshell, be realistic.  This isn't going to move the scale, its a vasesdilator.  You still get back what you put in via food and workouts.  Doing sit-ups doesn't take fat away from your stomach so putting this on it won't either.  If your looking for a little enhancement to your workout or interested in the skin byproducts, like me, then definitely give it a try.  If your trying to lose real weight and looking for a compliment to diet pills this isn't for you.  Your searching for a blunt tool to really attack your weight problem hard and fast and this is more like a finishing product or detail tool for people farther along.  If your there you know what I mean, if not you will when you get there.", "verifiedPurchase": true, "title": "Very Nice, but be realistic", "timestamp": "2016-10-17 10:42:19", "vine": false, "starRating": 4.0, "memberId": "A16TCN3FKABMUL", "nComments": 0, "date": "on June 1, 2014", "productId": "B001EN14CA", "id": "R1Q1DG3H8F4P3V", "helpful": [46]}

I've also had better results with this company's other similar product, their just plain Colon Cleanse not Super. There are two things you need to remember with this product, or with any product of this type. First, drink extra water. It can't work at all if you don't drink at least 3-4 big glasses of water a day while taking it. Second, this one contains senna which is, along with Cascara Sagrada, a stimulatory laxative. That means you shouldn't take it on an every day basis or you will become dependent on it. This product will eventually relieve constipation but it did not \"detox\" or \"cleanse\" anything. As soon as I stopped taking it everything went right back the way it was before - stopped up and bloated feeling. I'm looking for a stronger, more effective product now which is how I came to be on this page so I thought I'd add my experience with it.

A generous application over the torso, chest, and upper arms is what I use before every workout.

{"reviewTxt": "Haven't taken my test yet but I sure as hell hope this s*** works to get rid of my \"toxins\" because I'm trying really, really, really hard not to throw up while trying to hack this down. I'll update this to let you guys know if I pass or not using this. *Update* So I purchased this item and the Q tabs. I am a heavy smoker (almost every day for the last two years) and I was informed that I would have to take a drug test within the next two weeks. So for the last two weeks I have smoked once, and yesterday(3-27-16)I took the Qtabs, they made me so sick! But they must have worked... If you have a weak stomach eat something light with them. Immediately after I munched on some Wendy's. And that made me feel a lot better. I was going #1 ALL DAY after that, understandable, I drank a lot of water and cranberry juice. Going #2 occasionally. I read another reviews that it would be best to do this detox drink the day of the test. I read about the bad taste but boy did I underestimate it...you guys I barely got to half through half of it and nearly threw up all of it. All the water, cranberry juice and detox stuff. I stopped drinking it. I couldn't handle it. I was even plugging my nose and trying to drink it and would gag every time. I'm thinking the pills helped and the half of the drink helped, because I have to take my test in an hour and I went and got an at home test and tested negative for my \"toxins\". I don't use any heavy drugs, just the herb. If I could I'd rate it a zero based solely on taste, waisted my money and couldn't get it down. On the other hand, I would suggest the Qtabs. They're gross too, but not as bad.

{"reviewTxt": "I have been suffering from constipation since I can remember. I also have been trying EVERYTHING I can possibly think of; nothing has worked for me.

This magnesium doesn't cause any feeling whatsoever, it is as if we haven't take anything, just go to the bathroom everyday as if my system have always been that way. I am in my third bottle and if there is anything I can say I would take forever, if I needed too, it would be this Mag O.

{"reviewTxt": "This product is something I continue to use on an ongoing basis and it is of help some of the time. It is not always as effective as I would like it to be. Some days I find I have to take more capsules than it states to take and other days I do not. I'll be honest, I don't really understand how it works, when it works. I know it is magnesium based and somehow releases oxygen into the digestive tract on a time-released basis which creates a stool softening effect. I deal with IBS and spasms. I've had people tell me to use this or that and it will work. They promise me, but truthfully our bodies are all different and what works for one does not always work for another. I've actually used this product quite a bit and have hesitated to write a review because I don't want to dissuade others from trying it to see if it will work for them because it might be the best thing you've ever tried. I have a difficult digestive system that seems to march to its own drum and does what it wants and I will say this product has been the most helpful of many I have tried over the years. Spasming creates problems no matter what a person tries. If you have them, you know this. I think the better the diet and the more consistent one is in exercising the more effective a product like this is.

{"reviewTxt": "(James wife) The Super Colon Cleanse capsules absolutely work for me when I take 4 first thing in the morning and 4 at night before going to bed. 4 capsules was the magic number for me and my system. After reading many many reviews I started out with 2 capsules 2x a day for 2 days and no results. Then I took 3 capsules 2x a day for 2 days and no results. Then I took 4 capsules 2x a day and I started having results! For me, it is not \"keep you on the toilet\" results. It is a \"colon cleanse\" result. I am not cramping. I do not feel sudden urges and then fear I won't make it to the toilet. I am able to leave the house and not fear I won't make it to a restroom. I really like this product! Psyllium Husk alone does not work for me nor does Senna alone work for me. But, these capsules work for my system! So, while some people have great results with 2 capsules twice a day, I must take 4 capsules twice a day.  So I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a Colon Cleanse, but you may have to start out with 2 and see how your body reacts for a few days and work your way up until you find that magic number! I hate people give things bad reviews just because they don't try to tweak the dosage to work for them. Not everyone has the same system, some maybe more sensitive than others.

Drank plenty of water and had eaten something light before hand. After 24 hours of taking this I took 6 urine tests and all came out positive for thc. I took these tests over the span of 6 hours apart thinking it would work either instantly or take its time. I haven't tested myself since Ive written this review and have stayed clean since drank it. I'll retake another test which is going to be 3days since I drank it. If it comes out positive I know this detox is not for cleaning the body of thc.

{"reviewTxt": "Great product, using oxygen to cleanse your digestive system eliminates having to use caustic herbal remedies. The label says you can go UP TO,  five capsules, but during the cleanse phase I found 4 per night to be effective for me.

For maintenance, still experimenting with how low I can go, and frequency of use.  Very easy to use, no stomach griping like with some herbals.  Recommend not having to go anywhere the first couple of mornings, until you learn how quickly your system responds time wise, and intensity wise.

I stumbled on this product because I was ordering a belly belt and it came up to do a package with \"sweet sweat\" and I am greatful! I LOVE this product and the following is why: 1.  It works! I have dropped 1 pant size in 2 weeks of using this. 2.  It smell good. It has a floral scent. 3.  It makes your skin feel good.  I can honestly say this is the first product that has actually helped those problem bumpy, lumpy and stretch mark areas, plus it makes my skin feel so soft. 4.  The price is reasonable and affordable. Now I will say I was skeptical when I first started using it but now I'm purchasing more and my daughter is also using it. I would highly recommend using the neoprene shorts, and any other neoprene items with this since that is what I'm basing my results on.

{"reviewTxt": "Our daughter who is 3 years old has been suffering constipation since she was a little baby.  We've done everything to ensure that she has enough fiber and water, but that wasn't enough. It turns out she was actively withholding from pooping.  The pediatrician and Pediatric GI both concluded that she most like had a painful bowel movement and as a result, is holding her poop. By holding her poop, her colon grows and her feeling to go poop diminishes so she goes on longer and longer. Basically a downward spiral.  This has been completely heartbreaking and aggravating for us. We've tried toy/ice cream incentives. We've tried Miralax. Milk of Magnesia.  While Miralax helped, she complained of tummy aches.  Milk of Magnesia was fine as it kept her stools soft, but not more than that.  A parent of a child at my daughter's school recommended Mag 07 as she had the same issue as our daughter.  So we have been putting 2 1/2 pills in her bottle of milk before each night (we break open the capsules and make sure it is mixed in well).  She hasn't complained of tummy aches and her stools remain soft.  Now we are just at the point of waiting for her to break the cycle of being afraid of pooping.

I want to tell the world about this, it's life changing.  I was worried that adding all the oil would make me gain weight but it hasn't.  For anyone struggling with the same issues, give this and the coconut oil a try.
